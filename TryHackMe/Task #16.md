# Task #16: Darkness

There is something lurking in the dark.

## Background

By now, you know that even the description was not necessary as this photo is likely hiding something in plain sight. What is it, though? Based on the fact that this photo is fully covered in Black, let me guide you to a new realm in Steganography:

## Procedure

**Step #1:** While you can still use the usual Steganography tools, for this task you can use one with much more advanced capabilities such as [https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier)...\

**Step #2:** Upload the photo and click on the "Principal Component Analysis" attribute. You should now see the flag on the photo...

## Conclusion

This task tested our advanced knowledge of Visual Steganography in Forensics. We now know that an image could have other elements superimposed on it to give the illusion of colour, in this case Black. Is it just me or is that Task #17?
