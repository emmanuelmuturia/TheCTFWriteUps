## Background

The characters in the description and The Hint reveal that they are written in `Binaryfuck`, which is a spinoff of another esoteric language named `Brainfuck`. You already know where I am going with this, right?

This task challenged our skills in Obfuscation using Esolangs. Esolangs are esoteric programming languages, meaning that they are highly specialised. Is Task #14 here yet?
