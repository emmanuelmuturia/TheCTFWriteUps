Meta! meta! meta! meta...................................

[Please do not forget to download the task files too...]

## Background

From the task's description and the fact that we have been given a photo, the flag is likely located in the photo's metadata. To prove this hypothesis, here is what we are going to do:

## Procedure

**Step #1:** Let us upload the photo to any Metadata-viewing tool, shall we? You can use any that you prefer. For this task, I used [https://www.exif.tools](https://www.exif.tools)

**Step #2:** Scroll through the different attributes and guess what? You will find the flag in the "Owner Name" attribute...

## Conclusion

This task tested File Metadata Awareness and Forensics. By inspecting the photo's Metadata, you were able to retrieve the flag and learn how to look beyond what meets the eye, especially for photos. Before you celebrate, you know that Task #3 awaits you, right?
