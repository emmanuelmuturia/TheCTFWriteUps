# Task #10: Make a comment

No downloadable file, no ciphered or encoded text. Huh .......

## Background

As we have been told, there is no need to download anything. Where is the flag, then? When we check out The HInt, we have been clearly told to check the HTML COde of this task...

## Procedure

**Step #1:** To do that, we right click anywhere on the task and select "Inspect"...

**Step #2:** Next, we navigate to the code piece that visually represents the task, which is indicated on the left side of your screen...

**Step #3:** Navigate into the nested code and you find a tag with this attribute: style="display:none;". This means that its content is hidden from plain sight. When you navigate into it, you will for sure find the flag, meaning that it was just hidden from view but was present in the code...


## Conclusion

This task tested your abilities in Web Page Source Inspection & Hidden HTML Elements. It proved that yet again, just because something is not visible does not mean that it is not there. You should be tacking Task #11 by now...
