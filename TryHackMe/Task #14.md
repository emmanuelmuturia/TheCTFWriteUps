S1: 44585d6b2368737c65252166234f20626d
S2: 1010101010101010101010101010101010

## Background

Given the two Strings and The HInt, we already know what to do...

## Procedure

**Step #1:** Visit an online XOR tool and use the Strings as the input. 
**Step #2:** Make sure the output is in Base256 [ASCII], so please convert it if necessary. You should get the flag as the output...

## Conclusion

This task tetsed your understanding of Cryptography, specifically Cryptographic Operations like XOR. These operations make up the foundation of modern Cryptographic Algorithms. Task #15, here you are, I see...
