# Task #1: What does the base said?

Can you decode the following?

VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==

## Background

Based on the description, it is clear that our goal is to decode the given set of characters. The question, therefore, is what exactly are we decoding and to which format?

## Procedure

**Step #1:** First, we need to assess the characters and identify which format they correspond to. Given its size and the presence of '=' characters for padding, we can easily suspect that this is a Base64 set of characters...

**Step #2:** To prove this hypothesis, let us decode it using a Base64 decoder. There are a variety of ways to do this such as using an online converter. However, since you are a genius, you will be using a Linux command to do that...

**Step #3:** Open your Terminal and type the following command to get your flag: `base64 -d VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==`...

## Conclusion

This task was based on Encryption and Decryption, specifically in Base64. By this point, you have learnt how to use both online tools to decode Base64 characters. You are a genius and before you go and celebrate, stay tuned for Task #2 which is even better than this...
