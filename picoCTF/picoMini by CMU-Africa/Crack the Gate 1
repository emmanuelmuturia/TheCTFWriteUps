# Crack the Gate 1

We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Background

This Challenge had a downloadable Log File along with two Hints:

1] Developers sometimes leave notes in the code; but not always in plain text.
2] A common trick is to rotate each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.

It was classified under "Web Exploitation", and therefore it meant that it required you to apply some Web Application Security concepts to retrieve The Flag...

## Procedure

**Step #1:** The first step would be to view the Page Source, and sure enough, you will get a Comment written in ROT13. Decode that using a ROT13 Decoder to find the value of the Header which would allow a successful Login, despite the validity of the Password...

**Step #2:** Next, inspect the Website and navigate to the "Network" tab. Conduct a failed Login by using a random Password. Note the Entry generated in the "Network" tab. Right-click on it and copy it as cURL...

**Step #3:** Copy it and in your Terminal append this line that includes the Header we retrieved: -H 'X-Dev-Access: yes' \. The Response from this cURL Request will contain The Flag


## Conclusion

This Challenge tested your understanding of different Web Exploitation Techniques, such as Dev-Backdoors in this case...
