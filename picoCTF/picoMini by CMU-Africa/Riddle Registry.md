# Riddle Registry

Hi, intrepid investigator! 📄🔍 You've stumbled upon a peculiar PDF filled with what seems like nothing more than garbled nonsense. But beware! Not everything is as it appears. Amidst the chaos lies a hidden treasure—an elusive flag waiting to be uncovered.
Find the PDF file here Hidden Confidential Document and uncover the flag within the metadata.

## Background

This Challenge had a downloadable PDF File along with two Hints:

1] Don't be fooled by the visible text; it’s just a decoy!
2] Look beyond the surface for hidden clues

It was classified under "Digital Forensics", and therefore it meant that it required some Forensic Analysis...

## Procedure

**Step #1:** This was relatively straightforward, even without the Hints. First, download and open the PDF File...

**Step #2:** Next, look through the Text and reveal the Hidden Text by highlighting the Black Rectangles. You will find no Flag. That is expected. However, what if The Flag is not inside the PDF File?

**Step #3:** Close the PDF File and right-click it, and check the "Properties". Notice something in the "Author" attribute. It looks like a Base64 String, does it not? Copy it and decode it from Base64. There is your Flag...


## Conclusion

This Task tested your ability to look for Clues that are hidden in Plain Sight, as a necessary skill in Digital Forensics...
